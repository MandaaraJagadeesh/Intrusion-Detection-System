# Intrusion Detection System 

A machine learning project for detecting intrusions in network traffic using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project leverages deep learning techniques to identify anomalous patterns indicative of potential security threats.

## Features

- **Intrusion Detection**: Identifies potential intrusions or attacks in network traffic data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Processes and transforms network traffic data into a format suitable for CNN input.
- **CNN Model**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks to classify network traffic as normal or malicious.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip
- TensorFlow/Keras


## Model Performance

The performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) will be displayed after training. The evaluation results will help assess the model's effectiveness in detecting intrusions.
